A) allows us to write asynchronous, non-blocking code


2. Compositon over Inheritance

By using composition, we can create flexible, maintainable code that allows players to have different combinations of skills. This approach adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle and the Open-Closed Principle, making our design robust and easy to extend.

Inheritance can lead to a rigid structure thatâ€™s hard to manage and extend. Composition, on the other hand, provides flexibility and makes it easier to manage and extend our codebase as new requirements emerge.
